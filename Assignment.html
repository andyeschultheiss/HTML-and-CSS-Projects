		<p>The Snake Plant, known by its scientific name <i>Sansevieria trifasciata</i> and also commonly as Mother-in-Law's Tongue, is a popular houseplant.
		Depending on variety, its stiff leaves range from six inches to eight feet tall. As a houseplant, it was first cultivated in China, where it was believed
		to bestow the eight virtues of long life, prosperity, intelligence, beauty, art, poetry, health, and strength on its owners.</p>
		<p>In modern times, <i>Sansevieria</i> has found additional popularity on the basis of its ability to remove household pollutants such as benzene and formaldehyde
		from indoor air. NASA has even selected it, along with other houseplants, to study for their use in indoor air purification.</p>
		<p>Many indoor gardeners also appreciate the snake plant's hardiness. It is exceedingly drought-tolerant and gets by in both bright light and darker corners.
		The main consideration in care of a snake plant is choosing a well-draining soil. Typically something like an all-purpose cactus potting soil is best.</p>
		<p>Here is a quote from University of California's Agriculture and Natural Resources Master Gardeners website:</p>

		<blockquote cite="https://ucanr.edu/blogs/blogcore/postdetail.cfm?postnum=38910">
		Frost, direct light from a bright window, and overwatering (or high humidity) are like kryptonite to this plant.
		Avoid that trifecta and your plant should thrive indoors or, in mild climates, outdoors.
