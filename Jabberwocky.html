			’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br>
			&nbsp;Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:<br>
			All mimsy were the borogoves,<br>
			&nbsp;And the mome raths outgrabe.<br><br>

			“Beware the <span style = "font-weight:bold; color:rgb(59,122,87);">Jabberwock</span>, my son!<br>
			&nbsp;The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!<br>
			Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun<br>
			&nbsp;The frumious Bandersnatch!”<br><br>

			He took his vorpal sword in hand;<br>
			&nbsp;Long time the manxome foe he sought—<br>
			So rested he by the Tumtum tree<br>
			&nbsp;And stood awhile in thought.<br><br>

			And, as in uffish thought he stood,<br>
			&nbsp;The <span style = "font-weight:bold; color:rgb(59,122,87);">Jabberwock</span>, with eyes of flame,<br>
			Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,<br>
			&nbsp;And burbled as it came!<br><br>

			One, two! One, two! And through and through<br>
			&nbsp;The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!<br>
			He left it dead, and with its head<br>
			&nbsp;He went galumphing back.<br><br>

			“And hast thou slain the <span style = "font-weight:bold; color:rgb(59,122,87);">Jabberwock</span>?<br>
			&nbsp;Come to my arms, my beamish boy!<br>
			O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!”<br>
			&nbsp;He chortled in his joy.<br><br>

			’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br>
			&nbsp;Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:<br>
			All mimsy were the borogoves,<br>
			&nbsp;And the mome raths outgrabe.<br><br>
